CI - building code from git and send to container registry using Jenkins ??
CD - from container registry to pod ??

*** k8s - container orchestrator
      workload placement
      infra abstruction
      desired state

*** k8s API - RESTful API over HTTP using JSON
       API Objects - collection of primitives to represent system's state. 
            Pods - one or more containers. Ephemeral.
            Controllers - creates pods, defines the desired state
                  Deployment
                  ReplicaSet
            Services - networking abstraction for access to pods thereby adding persistency to the ephemeral pods
            Storage - persistent volume defined at the cluster level
       Configuration - Declarative or Imperative.

*** k8s Architecture
      Control Plane Node/Master Node
            API Server - stateless, interaction is done via kubectl
            etcd - cluster datastore, preserves state of the system
            Scheduler - lifecycle
            Controller Manager - monitoring
            Cluster Add-on Pods - DNS, Ingress Controller, Dashboard, Network Overlays
      Node/Worker Node
            Kubelet - pod lifecycle
            Kube-proxy - pod networking
            Container Runtime - docker/containerd etc.

*** Installation
      Cloud: IaaS - virtual machine, PaaS - managed service
      kubeadm - k8s cluster installation tool
      CRI (Container Runtime Interface) - containerd/docker/CRI-O
      Network Ports
            6443 : API
            2379-2380 : etcd

      Packages
            containerd
            kubelet
            kubeadm
            kubectl
      kubeadm bootstrapping:
            pre-flight checks - permission, resources, container cuntime
            creates CS - authentication, encryption
            generates Kubeconfig files - how to connect to cluster API server
                  /etc/kubernetes
                  admin.conf, kubelet.conf, controller-manager.conf, scheduler.conf
            generates Static Pod Manifests - describes configuration for system pods
                  /etc/kubernets/manifests
            waits for system pods to start
            taints the master node - only system pods run on master node
            generates bootstrap token - joining additonal nodes
            starts add-on pods
      Pod Networking
            Direct routing
            Overlay networking - Calico, Flannel, WeaveNet
